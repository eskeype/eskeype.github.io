My name is Sameer Punjal, and I'm a software developer who was born and raised in Pittsburgh. I majored in Mathematics and minored in Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I love algorithms - I'm a huge LeetCode enthusiast, and I love solving math problems - especially discrete math.

I made this site to talk about some of my favorite projects I've worked on, along with some posts on *algorithms* and *math*.

My hobbies, apart from Math and CS are:

- I train in Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu. I'm currently out due to a minor injury, but I have been training at [Stout Training Pittsburgh](http://stouttrainpitt.com/). Its a great gym, and they treat their beginners very well
- I love to travel. In college, I studied abroad in the [Math in Moscow](https://www.mccme.ru/mathinmoscow/) program. I met some incredible people, I became a much stronger mathematician, and I fell in love with Russian art and culture. If you have any questions about this program, reach out to me and I'll be sure to answer them.
- I play drums. As a kid I learned how to play the Indian tabla as well along with the Western drum kit. Lately I've been teaching myself to play the piano as well
